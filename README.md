Hey there!

This repo is home to my PHP studies and projects. Since I'm still learning and exploring the language, I decided to host my code here on GitHub.

Why GitHub?

I used to use EasyPHP to host my PHP projects locally. But, I ran into some bugs and limitations, so I decided to move my stuff over to GitHub.

Plus, I'm working on a login system project and I definitely don't want to lose any of my code or studies. GitHub is a safe and 
reliable way to store and version my projects, so I can always access and check them out whenever I need to.

GitHub Benefits
I think I've got a lot to gain by using GitHub. Not only do I keep my projects safe and sound, 
but I'm also boosting my deploys and getting the hang of Git for version control.


Thanks
Thanks to everyone who's been supporting and encouraging me in my PHP learning journey. I hope this repo is helpful to you too!
